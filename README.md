# Web App Dev 2: Web API Labs

Practical labs for the WAD2 module, 9th April.

My name is Conor Parle and this is my assignment 2 for Web App. 

I completed all of the labs required for this assignment, these were labs 9-12. 

Once I had finished the labs I got to adding a popular movies page, I wasn't able to complete the adding of a popular movies page but I have left all of my attempts in my code so that you can see what I was trying to do. 

I added some welcome text to the public page so that you are greeted and you can see what you can view.
